:toc-placement!:

A simple "Hello, World!" application written in Go and C++.

toc::[]

== Description

This is a basic application that demonstrates the classic "Hello, World!" program in both Go and C++. It serves as a simple example of syntax and project structure for both languages.

== Requirements

* Go 1.24.4 or later
* C++ compiler (g++ or clang++)
* Make (for building the C++ version)
* Git (for cloning the repository)

== Installation

Clone the repository:

[source,bash]
----
git clone https://github.com/rdmueller/Hello-World.git
cd Hello-World
----

== Building

=== Go Version

To build the Go application:

[source,bash]
----
go build
----

This will create a binary named `hello-world` in the current directory.

=== C++ Version

To build the C++ application:

[source,bash]
----
cd cpp
make
----

This will create a binary named `hello-world-cpp` in the `cpp` directory.

== Running

=== Go Version

To run the Go application:

[source,bash]
----
./hello-world
----

Alternatively, you can build and run in one step:

[source,bash]
----
go run main.go
----

=== C++ Version

To run the C++ application:

[source,bash]
----
cd cpp
./hello-world-cpp
----

=== Expected Output

Both versions produce the same output:
----
Hello, World!
----

You can also provide a name as an argument:

[source,bash]
----
./hello-world Alice
# or
cd cpp && ./hello-world-cpp Alice
----

Output:
----
Hello, Alice!
----
